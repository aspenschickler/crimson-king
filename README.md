### Court of the Crimson King

# Introduction
Court of the Crimson King is a 2D rougelike with turn based combat and procedurally generated dungeons. The game was made during one semester of CAP4053 (taught by Tom Carbone) by Zach and his two teammates, Michael Ferrara and Pranav Sharma. The game pairs a typical dungeon crawling experience with an eccentric musical theming to create 
an unusal rougelike experience.
