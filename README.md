### Court of the Crimson King

# Introduction
Court of the Crimson King is a 2D rougelike with turn based combat and procedurally generated dungeons. The game was made during one semester of CAP4053 (taught by Tom Carbone) by Zach and his two teammates, Michael Ferrara and Pranav Sharma. The game pairs a typical dungeon crawling experience with an eccentric musical theming to create an unusal rougelike experience.

The game was built with Unity, and is hosted on Github. A blog consisting of game updates and development history can be found at https://team11game.wordpress.com/blog-feed/, as well as the game's initial proposal.
